# HippoCampusLearnerFlashCards

## Description

This is a client-side application that allows users to create flash cards, similar to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). For more details about the project and the hackathon, you can view the devpost [here](https://devpost.com/software/hippocampus-learner).

## How it works

It uses cookies to allow offline persistent storage. It also lets users import and export their decks, so that decks can be shared between users.

## Usage

I wouldn't recommend this over [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). But I guess you can use it however you see fit.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and change directory into it.
2. View the page by opening index.html.
